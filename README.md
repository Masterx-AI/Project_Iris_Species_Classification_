### Description:
* The Iris Dataset consists of mutiple samples of Iris Flower.
* The Iris flower is categorized into 3 species namely - Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica.<br>
* These species vary in the dimensions of the sepals & petals.

### Objective:
- Import the Iris Dataset from sklearn library.
- Build classification models to predict the species.
- Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms.

### The Project is divided into the following steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Data Manipulation
5. Predictive Modeling
6. Project Outcomes & Conclusions

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Dataset was quiet small totally just 150 samples & after preprocessing 3.3% of the datasamples were dropped. It was also balanced & didn't require any artificial techniques to balance it.
- Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the class seperability.
- Feature selection or feature extracting as there were only 4 features, which all contributed towards the right prediction.
- Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
- While, Decision Tree Classifier algorithm gave the best overall scores for the current dataset, yet it wise to also consider simpler models as they are more generalisable.
